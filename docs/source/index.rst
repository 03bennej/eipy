Welcome to Ensemble Integration's documentation!
================================================

Ensemble Integration (EI) is a customizable pipeline for generating diverse ensembles of heterogeneous classifiers,
as well as the accompanying metadata needed for ensemble learning approaches utilizing ensemble diversity for 
improved performance. It also fairly evaluates the performance of ensemble learning methods including
`stacked generalization <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608005800231>`_ (stacking) methods,
and `ensemble selection <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1015330.1015432>`_.
