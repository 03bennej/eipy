Welcome to Ensemble Integration's documentation!
================================================

**Ensemble Integration (eipy)** leverages multi-modal data to build classifiers using a late fusion approach. 
In eipy, base predictors can be trained on each modality before being ensembled at the late stage. 

This implementation of eipy can utilise `sklearn-like <https://scikit-learn.org/>`_ models only, therefore, for unstructured data,
e.g. images, it is recommended to perform feature selection prior to using eipy. We hope to allow for a wider range of base predictors, 
i.e. deep learning methods, in future releases.
